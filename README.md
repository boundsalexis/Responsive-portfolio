## Built With

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

## Difficulties
* I got very comfortable positioning divs within divs
* Before making this I did not understand how using dev tools in the browser could be useful, I am now very comfortable using them and love how simple it can make the testing process.
